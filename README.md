# Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Character Generator

This program allows the user to quickly go through the initial steps of character creation. Using a text based menu the user will have an editable pdf accurately documenting their race, class, ability scores, skills, languages, proficiencies, associated features. The user will still need to reference the Player's Handbook to choose Background, Class Features, Equipment, and Spells. The page numbers referenced in the program correspond to the Player's Handbook. Encountering an issue or chance for me to improve this project? Feel free to let me know!
